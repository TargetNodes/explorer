`TargetNodes Dashboard` is a light explorer for Cosmos-based Blockchains.  https://targetnodes.com .

## What is the difference between TargetNodes explorer and other explorers? 

`TargetNodes Dashboard` is designed to explore blockchain data as real as possible, therefore there is no cache, no pre-processing. `TargetNodes Dashboard` only fetch data from Cosmos full node via LCD/RPC endpoints. We call it "Light Explorer".

We remain neutral to all chains, and we do not comment on their market prospects, technical risks, or investment risks.

## Why TargetNodes explorer use official/trusted third party public LCD/rpc server? 

There are two main reasons:

   - Trust, in a decentralized system, anything controlled by one entity cannot be trusted. So we decided to build with the community.
   - Limited resources: `TargetNodes Dashboard` will list hundreds of cosmos-based blockchains in the future, and it is impossible for our team to run validators or full nodes for all of them.
